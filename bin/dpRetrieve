=head1 NAME

dpRetrieve - Retrieve files in manner consistent with CADC implementation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    dpRetrieve --inputs=name_of_filelist

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The CADC processing environment provides a command for retrieving files
from the CADC archive using URIs provided in a text file. The command
written here is a compatibility version to allow the data processing
system to be tested outside of the CADC environment.

The test version of dpRetrieve can work on full paths
to local files, or file names relative to the value of the
ORAC_DATA_IN environment variable. Current working directory is used
if ORAC_DATA_IN is unset or if the file does not exist in that directory.

If the files are present in the current working directory they will be
touched so that the DR wrapper can recognize that the file is to be
processed. If they are present through a soft link in the local
directory the link is removed and recreated for the same reason. If
the file is in a remote directory a soft link is created. If the file or
soft link pre-exists a check is made to ensure that the new file is the
same as the old file.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item B<--verbose>

Write informational messages to standard error. Not supported by CADC.

=item B<--outdir>

Controls the directory used to write files that have been
retrieved. Files are located using current working directory (if they
are path-less) regardless of the setting of this parameter. Defaults
to current working directory. This argument is not compatible with
CADC and should not be used by the wrapper script.

=item B<--inputs>

The name of a text file containing either file URIs or path to a file.
